# GMS Tasks - Manipulate

The purpose of the `manipulate` command is for us to test different things and eventually move them into a task.  THIS IS NOT A PRODUCTION COMMAND.

## Installation

In the config file `gms-tasks-config.json`, we have these values that we can configure:

```
"manipulate": {
  ...
}
```

* `manipulate` - these change the config values for this command

## Running

Run `npm run manipulate` to run a command that mainpulates files for GMS.
